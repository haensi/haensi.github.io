# Early Retirement: 40 years and the best to come

What do Mark Cuban, Benjamin Franklin and Warren Buffet have in common?
They shared one principle: they used their skills, time and effort to retire early.
Only after they retired, they achieved their greatest achievements:

At age 42, Benjamin Franklin retired from his printing job so he could spend more time with his scientific pursuits.
At age 30, Mark Cuban sold his company for $6 million. He was able to retire.
At age 25, Warren Buffet decided to leave a successful hedge fund and return to Omaha.

No matter what your age is – if you are older than one or all of the examples above, you can still learn from them. The principles they used to achieve their status helped them to attain greater goals.

## What is your Motivation?
There are many motivations why a person might want to retire. In the following sections, we will have a look at different perspectives and motivations.

### Frustration
Here comes a list with things that are frustrating and might provoke the desire to retire:

* boring 9 - 5 job full of meetings, emails, discussions, calls, waiting for Friday and dealing with frustration?
* not enough time for hobbies
* abusive colleagues / boss
* not earning enough money
* burnout or other health issues
* lack of meaning in life

If you are (fill in your negative word of choice) with life,

### High Ambitions
You might think that your current situation does not allow you to use your full potential.
While straightforward education without interruption might seem the best life design for many people, there are numerous exceptions that show that extraordinary achievements can be created when people are not put under pressure, but when they can let their potential develop freely without too much external pressure, but internal pressure, patience.

Many careers don't start in a linear setup. Great accomplishments can happen early or later in life.

@todo:
add 10 under 10,
add 20 under 20,
add 30 under 30,
add 40 under 40,

### Family
There are things in life that are more fulfilling than work. In our families, we can enjoy the growth of trust and relationships. The more time we spend with our beloved, the healthier our relationships, marriages, families and social circles become. When we have more free time at our disposal, we can see how our children grow and teach them. When we have more time, we can foster friendships that increase of quality of life.

### Curiosity
Benjamin Franklin dedicated many months to pursue his interest in science (the relationship between oil and water, electricity, writing, anatomic research, ...)

### Independence

### Travel More

### Learn new Languages


Then this is for you. If you are looking for an easy way and low-hanging fruit? Then this is not for you. But if you are willing to actively plan and prepare your early retirement, you are pretty well prepared for achieving your goal. Nobody said it will be easy, but it will be worth it.

# Define Your Life Goals
So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. (Psalm 90:12)

What is your purpose in life? What are you living for? Where do you derive meaning? What motivates you?
How are you spending your life?

## Your Life in Weeks
Statistically, a the average American has a lifespan of [78.74 years](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN), that is about 4106 weeks.
That means that you experience the delight of a weekend more than 4000 times in your life.


The blog Wait but Why makes a very visual illustration of life and how we spend it.

The underlying message is this: you only have a limited amount of time on this earth. Make it count.

# Planning your early retirement

> My guiding principle and motivation was that I wanted to retire by the time I turned 35. There actually are two books that I bought and still have - Paul Terhost's 'Cashing In On the American Dream: How to Retire at 35' and Andrew Tobias's 'The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need' - that were my personal financial road map. Mark Cuban, American businessman and investor.

## The Avalanche Effect
An avalanche is defined as a mass of snow and ice that rapidly descend a mountainside. The word `avalanche` is of French and Italian origin. In French, `aval` is the lowest point, close to the valley. [They go down to the valley, hence, *à val*](https://french.stackexchange.com/a/13904)

@TODO Describe avalanche: start small with a ver little step and getting

> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it." Albert Einstein

The principle of compound interest is very simple, yet very powerful. Many understand it only better, when they see it visualized.
The following diagram shows how $ 1000 evolve over 40 years. Once with a normal interest of 4% and once with a compound interest of 4%.



![Compound Interest](img/compound-interest.png)

If you start investing money in your early 20s, you have an immense advantage over people who start investing in your 30s or even later.
Starting with $1000 at the age of 20 and a yearly compound interest of 4%, you'll achieve $7040 by the age of 60. You earn $6040.
If you start at the age of 30, you only make $4322.
That's a difference of $1718. Two times you have the starting investment of $1000, but the outcome is very different.
By investing 10 years earlier, you yield more than 28% more money. And that without any extra payment, only with an earlier payment.

# Discipline
## Work Hard

Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Benjamin Franklin
As mentioned before, you have to earn your early retirement. Keep in mind: would you rather be a millionaire who inherited a lot of money by doing nothing or would you prefer to see that your effort really makes a difference?
In order to achieve that goal, you have to work hard. At the same time, you have to work smart. In this chapter, we'll focus on how to get work done.

* plan your work
* prioritize
* delegate
* declutter your work
* working hard
* give all you got in your studies and daily job
* excel at what you're really good at
%TODO: describe fascinating personality that focused on gift, despite what others said

* single-mindedness
* fighting spirit

## Read
> An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. (Benjamin Franklin)

### Blogs
A very valuable source for knowledge and learning is by reading books or blogs. The following blogs and websites are from different persons who either experiment with early retirement or at least have some very helpful tips on how to get there.
The majority of the blogs are very transparent and openly share the earnings, net worth and other financial details.
[From Cents to Retirement](http://www.fromcentstoretirement.com/) describes the journey of a man who has planned to retire at the age between 33 - 36 years. He is working towards his goal by making real estate investments and investing parts of his money in the stock markets.

[The Four Hour Work Week](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) by Tim Ferris describes different experiments in entrepreneurship, travel and economics. The author is a successful angel investor. In his podcast, he frequently interviews other entrepreneurs and leaders which is a great resource for entrepreneurial thinking.

[Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) describes the experiments and insights of a blogger who retired early and who shares his experiences with that lifestyle. He shares details on how to save money, live a frugal life and how to best use the time every human has.

[MyMoneyWizard](http://mymoneywizard.com/) describes strategies and plans to use an average income and a disciplined strategy (saving 60+ % of net income) to increase the net worth.

Sawdust is a byproduct of the lumber industry, and feathers are a byproduct of poultry processing. In each of these cases, the byproduct is important and useful, but secondary to the initial product.
