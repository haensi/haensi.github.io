# About Hans Ramsl
The fully legal version of my name is Hans-Martin Ramsl.

## Roots
The name is rooted in 3 entities:
1. Yahweh
2. Mars
3. Bear garlic

Etymologically, the name can be traced to the following elements:
* יוֹחָנָן‬ (Yohanan) → Ιωάννης (Ioannes) → Johannes → `Hans`
* Mars → Martinus → `Martin`
* hramusô (“onion, leek”) →  ramsyn →  [ramson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_ursinum)  → `Ramsl`

Born and raised in southern Germany, I'm passionate about leadership, language, learning and thinking.

## Bio

### Education
After spending one year in Chile as a humanitarian worker, I studied Computational Linguistics, Computer Science in Germany's oldest University in Heidelberg.
