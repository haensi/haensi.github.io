# Word Musings: Poly, Philos, Maths, 

Language is so fascinating. English has many words that come from ancient Greek.
The fun thing about words with greek origin is that they have characteristics that are so innate to the greek thinking: As the thinking is analytical, so are the words and concept.

That means that you can combine them to create new words with new meanings.
Think of them as [Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego) bricks that can be combined.
