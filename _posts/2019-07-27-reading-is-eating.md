# Reading is eating

People who change the world are voracious readers . In order to acquire knowledge about the world we live in, we need vast amount of knowledge. Knowledge is transferred in many different ways. It can be transmitted via oral experience, hands on learning or reading.

In a century where social media are the ruling source of knowledge, it has become more and more difficult, to get a firm grasp of deep realities. We have forgotten to dedicate quality time to reading, discipline ourselves to reach reading goals And even tackle challenging literature.

The good book needs to be digested like a good steak. It takes time to prepare it, it takes time to chew it, and it takes time to digest it. Yet, the nutritional value of a steak and strong food is far higher than the nutritional value of a hamburger or french fries.

Social media can be compared to fast food:
It is tasty, it is easy to consume, and we never get enough. At the same time, we feel unfulfilled, and a longing for the real stuff remains.

It goes without asking that an athlete who strives for success has to focus on her diet, eating high-quality food and disciplining herself to enough work out and training.

If you want to be successful in the long run, you better get started and develop a healthy reading habit.

What are you eating? What are you drinking? How often do you exercise?

What are you reading? What are you listening to? How often do you dedicate time to study a  text?
